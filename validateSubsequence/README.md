- Initialize seqIndex which will act as a pointer for the second list (subsequence list)
- Loop through the second list and check if the value exists in the first list
- If that number from the second list is present in the first list, then add one to the index and push the pointer to the next number in second list
- Do this until you reach the end of the second list (index === secondList.length)
